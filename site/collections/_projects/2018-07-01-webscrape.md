## Problem Statement
In the dynamic and data-intensive energy trading sector, the need for real-time, accurate supply and demand data is paramount. Traders and investors were struggling with outdated and unreliable data sources, impeding their ability to make swift and informed market decisions. Additionally, the lack of a robust, efficient HTML parser tailored to .NET frameworks further complicated the data extraction process from complex web structures.

## Solution
Developed a comprehensive suite of solutions to address the core issues faced by traders and investors. The project involved three major components:

1. **Web Scraping Programs:** Implemented advanced web scraping programs using LINQ, specifically designed to extract vital supply and demand data from various energy operators' websites. These programs were capable of navigating and parsing complex web structures to retrieve up-to-date and accurate market data.

2. **HTML5 Parser .NET Standard Library:** Developed a custom HTML5 parser .NET Standard library, modeled after an existing JavaScript parser, to serve as a cornerstone for future web scraping endeavors. This parser was crafted to integrate seamlessly with .NET frameworks, ensuring high performance and reliability in data extraction tasks.

3. **Library Unit Testing:** Rigorously unit-tested the web scraping library using NUnit to ensure the reliability, performance, and accuracy of the scraping tools. This testing phase was crucial in identifying and addressing potential issues, paving the way for a robust and fault-tolerant solution.

## Tools Used

- **WebLINQ**: The core library developed for streamlined and efficient web scraping.
- **LINQ**: Utilized for querying data within the web scraping programs, offering clear and concise syntax.
- **.NET Standard Library & C#**: Chosen for the development of the HTML5 parser, ensuring optimal performance and integration with the WebLINQ library.
- **NUnit**: Employed for meticulous unit testing of the library, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the scraping tools.


## Outcome
The project successfully revolutionized the data acquisition process for traders and investors in the energy market. The tailored web scraping programs provided real-time, accurate market data, significantly enhancing market prediction models and investment strategies. The custom HTML5 parser further streamlined the data extraction process, offering high performance and seamless integration with .NET frameworks. The rigorous unit testing ensured the reliability and robustness of the solution, instilling confidence in its performance and accuracy. Overall, the project marked a significant advancement in data-driven decision-making within the energy trading sector.
