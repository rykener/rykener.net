### Problem
[Reus Pharma](https://www.reuspharma.com/), a growing pharmaceutical company headquartered in Guatemala was seeking to amplify its social media presence, but faced challenges in consistently publishing timely, relevant, and platform-optimized content. The manual process of content curation, customization, and posting was resource-intensive and lacked the necessary promptness and platform-specific adaptation. Additionally, the company wanted to amplify its online visibility without the need to hire a dedicated social media manager, aiming for a cost-effective yet efficient solution.

### Solution
To address these challenges, a social media bot that automated the process of content curation, posting, and optimization was designed and implemented. The solution involved:

1. **Content Curation**: Leveraging Feedly AI, the solution continuously monitors and aggregates trending and pertinent articles from diverse sources, ensuring a steady stream of quality content.
   
2. **Automated Posting**: Through Zapier's powerful automation, the bot instantly creates posts whenever a selected article is added to a designated Feedly board. These posts include captivating images from the articles and concise summaries, enhancing visual appeal and engagement.

3. **Content Optimization with ChatGPT**: Recognizing the nuances of different social media platforms, ChatGPT is integrated to refine the text summaries further. This AI model adeptly corrects texts, tailors the tone and style for platforms like Instagram and LinkedIn, and ensures that the content resonates well with the target audience, enhancing engagement and relevance.
