    description_html: >-
      <p>Hi, I'm Eleanor, sometimes known as Lithium. I am a community care worker offering emotional, spiritual, and logistical support to people in a variety of life circumstances. I help clients develop systems of growth to aid in their resilience against a harsh world. Creating a non-judgemental, collaborative environment from which to navigate lifeâ€™s changes together, we can build and grow into a new phase of your life as a team. I operate on a sliding scale and am experienced working with people at the intersection of multiple marginalized communities, most explicitly the queer and disabled communities.</p>
      <p>I am currently focusing on my education and am only taking a small number of clients on a case by case basis. You are welcome to contact me.</p>
