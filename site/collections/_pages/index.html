    title: Chronic Illness Peer Coaching
    description_html: >-
      <p>Hi, I'm Eleanor, AKA Lithium. I work with people with chronic illness to help find acceptance and perspective. We collaborate together to come to a place where it is easier to relax in what is so often a viscous ableist world. I also help people through the process of seeking diagnosis and treatment. Whatever part of sick-life you're struggling to live with and integrate into we can work together to find harmony. I do not offer cures.</p><br><p>I am a transfeminine person who has lived with a variety of illnesses since birth, most recently dealing with very severe ME/CFS. You can read more about me <a href="/about">here</a>.</p>

    content_title: Nice Things People Said
    content_html: >-  
      <p>Here's some nice things people have said about me and my writing over the last year or two.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I am grateful for the support and friendly ear during what was a very hard couple of weeks for me. I can't tell you how much your compassion and understanding helped me feel less alone.</li>
        <li>Thanks for posting such thought provoking stuff. Your [writing] genuinely helped me figure out that I want to be a social worker.</li>
        <li>The way you express ideas often inspires thought in me and encourages me me to feel more comfortable in myself and more confident in my place within the world</li>
        <li>Your writing has been a huge inspiration to me on my journey towards healing.</li>
        <li>Thank you for being such a beam of good. I've grown to really appreciate your dedication and your perspective on being an older<sup>*</sup> transfem and owning that position as a compassionate member of the trans community to younger transfolk... If I make it to be older, I wanna adopt your compassion</li>
      </ul>
      <sup>*</sup>guys, I'm in my 30s, chill.
