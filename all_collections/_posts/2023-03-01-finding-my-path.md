_TLDR; Hold on tight, because life is a rollercoaster. Try to enjoy the ride though, it’s actually pretty fun!_

I began my career by getting fired from my own startup project. Far from discouraging me, it gave me strength and clarity to tackle new challenges.

After a period of burning cash, I needed to find a way to generate a steady income while gaining experience to launch my own business one day.

Consulting seemed to respond best to those needs. My entourage, however, did not seem as enthusiastic:

> “You don’t start a career in consulting.”
> 
> “Engineers who work in consulting waste their potential.”
> 
> “Consulting is hard work. Can you handle it?”

Moreover, my initial consulting experience had been quite hectic, to say the least.

After graduating from EPFL, my startup mentor hired me for a consulting gig. He, his client, and I met for a drink one afternoon to discuss a project. We established deadlines, defined a scope, and off I was to begin my summer project.

A few weeks in, my mentor disappeared without any prior notice. He went on holiday and completely disconnected for nearly a month. Unexpectedly, I was left to handle the client on my own.

The client was eager to disrupt the real estate industry with technology, while I was more focused on meeting expectations. I felt my job hanging by a thread, but I managed to deliver a report detailing realty pricing models that would be subsequently put to use.

Weeks after getting that load off my back, my startup crashed. My last 2 years were gone in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, my university career fair was just around the corner. Out on the market with a failed startup story to tell, every company wanted to hire me.

Skipping over several rounds of interviews, I joined Capgemini’s Insights and Data practice as a Data Analyst. A brand new team consisting of fresh consultants eager for success, led by a distinguished and experienced consultant. We were determined to attack the Swiss market, which was ripe for digitalization after the pandemic. On paper, the project seemed exciting, but in reality, it was destined for disaster. I wasn’t enjoying my experience there, so I left soon after.

During the career fair, I was also in touch with Open Web Technology, a smaller yet reputable consulting firm. Although my head led me towards Capgemini, my heart always pumped for Open Web. The on-site interview had left a great impression on me: they were a small family of entrepreneurs sharing a similar background to mine. After leaving Capgemini, I knew where I wanted to be.

The job did not disappoint. A few months in, I truly believed that I had found my dream job. I was learning a great deal, team events were fun, and, unlike before, my voice was heard.

Naturally, I began taking on more and more responsibilities. With the onset of cold winter days, however, I started feeling overwhelmed. “Had I taken on too much too quickly?” I wondered. Everything was happening so fast, I had no time to pause and reflect. As we were delivering my biggest project yet, I took some time off and realized that the company and I were no longer aligned. I wasn’t growing the way I wanted to, so I quit shortly thereafter.

Nonetheless, I learned some important lessons from my experiences:

- A larger company does not necessarily mean it is better for you. As companies grow, they become less prone to taking risks. Their focus shifts toward maintaining profits and market share. Ideally, you should find a company that you can grow with.
- My generation is used to quick wins and quick rewards (thank you smartphones). When we don’t receive them promptly, we become disappointed. This is important to keep in mind because building trust takes time. Based on my experiences, it takes even longer with older generations.
- Going through several rounds of interviews is actually beneficial. You get to meet more people and get a better sense of the job. This will give you a better idea of what to expect once you start working.
- When you start a new job, you’re not starting over — you’re starting from experience. Your experience is what sets you apart from everyone else.

Life is a journey. The destination doesn’t matter as much as the experiences along the way. For me, that journey is only just beginning.
